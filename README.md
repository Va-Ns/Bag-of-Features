# Bag of Features Image Classification in MATLAB

This project is inspired by the code snippets available from the [ICCV of 2005](https://people.csail.mit.edu/fergus/iccv2005/bagwords.html). It implements a Bag of Features model for image classification in MATLAB. The model involves several steps including feature extraction, vector quantization, and classification using the intrinsic functions of MATLAB.

## Project Structure

- `Bag_Of_Features.m`: The main script for the project.
- `common/`: Contains various utility scripts and functions used in the project.
- `experiments/`: Contains scripts or data for testing the performance of the model.
- `images/`: Contains the image data that the model is trained and tested on.
- `RUN_DIR/`: Contains several subdirectories for different stages of the model, such as feature extraction and vector quantization.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed and set up on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `Bag_Of_Features.m` script to start the model.
